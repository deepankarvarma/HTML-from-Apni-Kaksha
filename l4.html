    <p>Cascade:- Lets assume that we have used a selector multiple times like this:- <br>
    h1{<br>color:blue;<br>}<br>
    h1{<br>color:red;<br>}<br>
    Cascade means that the value of h1 will be overwritten red from blue and the final color 
    will be red.
    <br>
    Next we have <b>Specificity</b>
    <br>
    After going through Specificity,Inheritance and Importance we have Overflow
    <br>
    
    <div class="box">This box has a height and width.This means that if there is too much
        content to be displayed within the assigned height, there will be an overflow situation.
        If overflow is set to hidden then any overflow will not be visible. <br><br>
        This content is outside the box.Different values of overflow are <br>
        <b>hidden(will hide the excess data),visible,
        scroll(a scroll bar will be available for scrolling the excess text)</b>
        But there is a catch that even when the height and width is beyond the required ones 
        and the overflow is scroll a scroll bar will be visible, so as to rectify this error
        use overflow:auto;       
    </div>
