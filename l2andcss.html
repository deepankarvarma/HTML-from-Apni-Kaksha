<!--Ways to link CSS in HTML
1.Inline e.g. <p style="">
2.External
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
3.Internal <style>{}</style>
Selectors :They are patterns through which we can select different HTML elements
Selectors Are demonstrated in style.css
1.Combined Selector:-
The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
h1,p,span{

}
2.Type Selectors:-
h1{

}
3.Class Selector:-
We know that we can assign a specific class to the elements and using that class
.classname{

}
4.ID Selector
#idname{

}
5.Attribute Selector
it is used to basically select a tag which has any attribute
a[href="google.com"]{

}
6.Pseudo Class Selector
format- 
selector(for ex.h1):pseudo-class{
    property:value;
}
Different pseudo classes/states:
:hover
:visited
7. Pseudo Element Selector
For instance ,We can use this to change the colour of the first line of a multi lined paragraph
p::first-line{

}
8.Combinator Selectors
For exaple we want to select all the p tags inside the article tag
article>p{

}
OR
article p{

}
9.Universal Selectors
Used to select everything
*{

}
10.Adjacent Selectors
These type of selectors are used to select a tag just after the preceding tag, and in case there 
is any tag b/w the two this wont work
For example we want to select p tag just after h1 tag we will write
h1+p{

}
