    <title>Styling Lists</title>
  </head>

    <p>
      In this lecture we will basically style the lists. <br >
      Now first tag is list-style-type: ; this will change the marker type of
      the List for ex. disc,square,roman etc.<br>
      Now lets assume that we have set a background color to the list items and
      we want that the marker should be visible on the background color then we
      will use <br>
      list-style-position: inside; outside will imply that the marker will not
      be covered in the background color
      <br>
      Next we have list-style-image:url();.This is used to set an image as a marker.
