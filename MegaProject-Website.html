    <!--We are structuring a mega project here. Making a website containing usage of navigation bar
    ,header,footer,article,section,main,aside .Now these tage were called semantic tages.Semantic 
    tags convey the related information to both user and coder
    Now non semantic tags are those whic dont have any specific purpose  for eg,div,span
    div and span tag is used to group lines
    The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
    div is a block element and span is an inline element-->
    <p>This is 1st paragraph</p>
    <p>This is 2nd paragraph</p>
    <em>
        This is em tag.
    </em>
    <em>it is used to emphasise text.

    </em>
    <!--The output indicates that the p tag is block as it occupies a whole horizontal line
    whereas in em tag both the lines were displayed in a single line-->
